# Covid19_Serbia

The main sense (1) is to create Epidemics Progression Index (EPI) per day. I am very greatfull that I had a chance to read a similar article about Italian cases, made by Angelica Lo Duca. You can look for deep code on https://towardsdatascience.com/italian-covid-19-analysis-with-python-1bdb0e64d5ac
Figure_1 describes model for EPI per day.
The main sense (2) is to predict when the virus crisis will be over.
Figure_2 describes forecast from April 21.
